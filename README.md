# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust
Here you can find solvers with example inputs. I'm trying my best to provide the best code.

There are no explainations or comments to these solutions. Also there are mangled variable names. It will be corrected later (maybe when AoC 2022 will end).

## Inputs
Add inputs in text files matching a binary name, like `01.txt`, into the `inputs/` directory.

## Testing
Use this command (replace `<day>` with approperiate 2-digit day number):
```sh
cargo ex <day>
```

## Running
Make sure there is an input text file in `inputs/` and then type the following command (replace `<day>` with the day number):
```sh
cargo solve <day>
```
